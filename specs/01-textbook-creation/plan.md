# Implementation Plan: AI/Spec-Driven Textbook Creation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Feature**: `01-textbook-creation` | **Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-12-09 | **Spec**: [specs/01-textbook-creation/spec.md](../specs/01-textbook-creation/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/01-textbook-creation/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a modular, highly structured textbook using Docusaurus, written through Spec-Kit Plus workflows, with content generated and refined using Claude Code. The textbook will cover Physical AI fundamentals, humanoid robotics concepts, practical robotics skills, and AI-driven workflows with exactly 4 chapters that include learning outcomes, real-world examples, diagrams/visuals, and practical exercises for each chapter.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown, MDX, JavaScript/TypeScript for Docusaurus
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, Node.js, Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code
**Storage**: Git repository with content stored in /docs directory
**Testing**: Content validation, Docusaurus build checks, link verification
**Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages)
**Project Type**: Documentation/static site
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading pages, accessible navigation, responsive design
**Constraints**: Must follow Docusaurus MDX structure, technical accuracy verified, beginner-friendly explanations
**Scale/Scope**: Exactly 4 chapters, 3,000-5,000 words per chapter, modular and maintainable content

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status: PASSED** - All constitution principles are addressed in the implementation approach

- Educational Excellence and Accessibility: Content will be technically accurate for robotics and AI while remaining accessible to beginners through the defined audience requirements (basic programming and math/physics knowledge)
- Modular and Maintainable Structure: Each chapter will follow standardized format with Overview → Concepts → Examples → Code → Exercises as required
- Spec-Driven Content Generation: All content will follow Spec-Kit Plus workflows with precise specifications through the defined pipeline
- Technical Accuracy and Clarity: All technical explanations will prioritize correctness while maintaining clarity, with verification by subject matter experts
- Docusaurus-Optimized Presentation: All content will be structured for Docusaurus with MDX format as specified in the architecture
- Human-Editable Autogenerated Content: All generated content will remain editable and logically structured in the Git repository

**Structure Decision**: Single documentation project using Docusaurus with modular chapter structure. Each chapter contains 5 files following the constitutional mandate: index.md (Overview) → concepts.md (Concepts) → examples.md (Examples) → code.md (Code) → exercises.md (Exercises).

**Module Organization**: The textbook is organized as a single module containing 4 chapters, each covering a major topic area. While the data model defines a Module entity, the implementation uses a flat chapter structure for simplicity, as each chapter is self-contained.

**Search Implementation**: Docusaurus built-in search using @docusaurus/preset-classic with algolia or local search plugin for full-text search with result highlighting.

**PDF Generation**: Using docusaurus-prince-pdf or @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs export features to generate printable/downloadable PDF versions of the textbook.
