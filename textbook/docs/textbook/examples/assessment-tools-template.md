# Assessment Tools Template

## Overview

This template provides a framework for creating assessment tools that evaluate student completion of exercises and projects in robotics education. The tools focus on measuring understanding, application of concepts, and practical skills development while providing meaningful feedback to support learning.

## Assessment Tool Types

### 1. Knowledge Check Assessments
- **Concept Verification**: Check understanding of fundamental concepts
- **Terminology Mastery**: Assess familiarity with robotics terminology
- **Principle Application**: Evaluate ability to apply principles to new situations
- **Problem Recognition**: Test ability to identify appropriate solutions

### 2. Performance-Based Assessments
- **Implementation Verification**: Check if students can implement concepts
- **Code Review**: Assess quality and correctness of code implementations
- **Design Evaluation**: Evaluate engineering design decisions
- **Analysis Tasks**: Measure analytical thinking and problem-solving

### 3. Portfolio Assessments
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor learning progression over time
- **Skill Demonstration**: Showcase mastery of multiple competencies
- **Reflection Documentation**: Capture metacognitive activities
- **Self-Assessment**: Encourage self-evaluation and goal-setting

### 4. Peer Assessment Tools
- **Collaborative Review**: Enable students to evaluate each other's work
- **Constructive Feedback**: Guide students in providing helpful feedback
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allow comparison of different approaches
- **Team Evaluation**: Assess collaborative and communication skills
