# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the AI/Spec-Driven Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

## A

The theory that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the environment, suggesting that the body influences the mind.

## E

### Embodiment
The concept that intelligence depends on the body's physical form and its interactions with the environment, not just on abstract computation.

### Environment
The physical or simulated world in which a robot or AI system operates, including all objects, surfaces, and conditions that affect its sensors and actuators.

### Exercise Difficulty Level
A classification system for textbook exercises using color-coded badges: 🟢 Beginner (basic understanding), 🟡 Intermediate (application and analysis), 🔴 Advanced (evaluation and creation).

## F

### Feedback Control
A control system that uses sensor information to adjust actuator commands and correct for errors, ensuring the system behaves as intended.

### Forward Kinematics
The process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector based on the known joint angles.

## G

### Gaussian Process
A collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution, used in machine learning for regression and classification tasks.

### Gazebo
A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides accurate physics simulation and realistic rendering.

## H

### Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
The study of interactions between humans and robots, focusing on design, development, and evaluation of robots for human use.

### Humanoid Robot
A robot with a body structure similar to that of a human, typically featuring a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

## I

### Inverse Kinematics
The process of calculating the required joint angles to achieve a desired position and orientation of a robot's end-effector.

### Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)
An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.

### Infima
A CSS framework designed to work well for content-centric websites, used by default in Docusaurus themes.

## K

### Kinematics
The branch of mechanics that deals with pure motion, without reference to the masses of the objects or the forces producing the motion.

## L

### LiDAR
Light Detection and Ranging - a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances to the Earth, commonly used in robotics for mapping and navigation.

### Learning Outcome
A clear, specific statement of what the learner will be able to do after completing a learning activity, typically following the format: "By the end of this [chapter/module], students will be able to [ACTION VERB] [CONTENT] [CONTEXT]."

## M

### Machine Learning
A type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every action.

### Markov Decision Process (MDP)
A mathematical framework for modeling decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker.

### Mobile-Responsive Design
A design approach that ensures web content displays properly on various devices and screen sizes, adapting layout and functionality as needed.

### Motion Planning
The computational problem of automatically planning a path for a robot or other moving object from a starting position to a goal position while avoiding obstacles.

### Morphological Computation
The idea that the physical body of an agent can perform computations that would otherwise need to be done by the controller, exploiting the body's physical properties for intelligent behavior.

## N
