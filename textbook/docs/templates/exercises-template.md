# Exercises Template

## Overview

This template provides a standardized approach for creating exercises for each chapter in the AI/Spec-Driven Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. Exercises should be designed with three difficulty levels to accommodate different learning stages.

## Difficulty Level System

### 🟢 Beginner (Basic Understanding)
- **Cognitive Level**: Remember, Understand
- **Time Required**: 10-20 minutes
- **Skills Required**: Basic recall and comprehension
- **Support Provided**: Detailed instructions, examples
- **Success Criteria**: Can recall and explain basic concepts

### 🟡 Intermediate (Application & Analysis)
- **Cognitive Level**: Apply, Analyze
- **Time Required**: 20-40 minutes
- **Skills Required**: Apply concepts to new situations
- **Support Provided**: Moderate guidance
- **Success Criteria**: Can apply concepts to solve problems

### 🔴 Advanced (Evaluation & Creation)
- **Cognitive Level**: Evaluate, Create
- **Time Required**: 40-60 minutes
- **Skills Required**: Synthesize multiple concepts
- **Support Provided**: Minimal guidance
- **Success Criteria**: Can create solutions and evaluate approaches
