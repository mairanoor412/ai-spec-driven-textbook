# Content Review Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the process for reviewing textbook content with subject matter experts (SMEs) in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. The review process ensures technical accuracy while maintaining educational quality.

## Review Team Structure

### Content Author
- Creates initial content following templates
- Performs self-review before submission
- Incorporates feedback from reviewers

### Peer Reviewer
- Reviews content for clarity and educational quality
- Checks adherence to templates and standards
- Provides feedback on structure and flow

### Subject Matter Expert (SME)
- Reviews technical accuracy of content
- Validates scientific and engineering concepts
- Ensures no hallucinated facts are present

### Editor
- Manages the review process
- Ensures all feedback is incorporated
- Approves content for the next state

## Review Process Flow

### Step 1: Content Preparation (Author)
- [ ] Complete content using appropriate templates
- [ ] Fill all placeholders with actual content
- [ ] Perform self-review using verification checklist
- [ ] Submit content for peer review with completion report

### Step 2: Peer Review (Peer Reviewer)
- [ ] Review content for clarity and educational quality
- [ ] Check adherence to textbook standards
- [ ] Identify areas needing SME review
- [ ] Provide feedback using standardized review form
- [ ] Rate content quality (1-5 scale)

### Step 3: SME Review (Subject Matter Expert)
- [ ] Review technical accuracy of identified sections
- [ ] Verify scientific and engineering concepts
- [ ] Check mathematical equations and formulas
- [ ] Validate code examples and algorithms
- [ ] Identify any technical inaccuracies
- [ ] Provide detailed feedback on technical issues
- [ ] Rate technical accuracy (1-5 scale)

### Step 4: Feedback Integration (Author)
- [ ] Review all feedback from peer and SME reviewers
- [ ] Incorporate suggested changes
- [ ] Address all technical concerns raised
- [ ] Update content as needed
- [ ] Resubmit for final review if major changes made

### Step 5: Final Approval (Editor)
- [ ] Verify all feedback has been addressed
- [ ] Confirm content meets quality standards
- [ ] Approve content for next state in workflow
- [ ] Update state tracking information

## Review Timeline

### Standard Review Process
- **Peer Review**: 3-5 business days
- **SME Review**: 5-7 business days
- **Feedback Integration**: 2-3 business days
- **Final Approval**: 1 business day
- **Total**: 11-16 business days

### Expedited Review Process
- **Peer Review**: 1-2 business days
- **SME Review**: 2-3 business days
- **Feedback Integration**: 1 business day
- **Final Approval**: 1 business day
- **Total**: 5-7 business days

## SME Review Guidelines

### Technical Accuracy Checkpoints
- [ ] All scientific concepts are accurately described
- [ ] Engineering principles are correctly explained
- [ ] Mathematical equations are accurate and properly formatted
- [ ] Code examples are functional and follow best practices
- [ ] Research citations are current and accurate
- [ ] Industry standards and best practices are followed
- [ ] No hallucinated facts or incorrect information

### Review Tools
- **Technical Reference Library**: Access to authoritative sources
- **Validation Software**: Tools for checking code examples
- **Cross-Reference Database**: Compare with other textbook sections
- **Expert Consultation**: Ability to consult with other SMEs if needed

### Review Output
For each section reviewed, SMEs should provide:

1. **Technical Accuracy Rating**: 1-5 scale
2. **Issues Found**: List of technical inaccuracies
3. **Suggested Corrections**: Specific recommendations
4. **Confidence Level**: High/Medium/Low for each section
5. **Additional Resources**: References for verification

## Quality Standards

### For SME Reviewers
- [ ] Technical accuracy must be 95% or higher
- [ ] All major concepts must be correctly explained
- [ ] Mathematical content must be error-free
- [ ] Code examples must be functional
- [ ] Scientific principles must be properly applied

### For Content Authors
- [ ] Must address 100% of technical feedback
- [ ] Should maintain educational quality while fixing technical issues
- [ ] Must verify all corrections with additional sources when needed
- [ ] Should improve content based on suggestions

## Communication Protocol

### Review Submission
- Use standardized form for all reviews
- Include specific examples and page/section references
- Provide clear, actionable feedback
- Rate overall content quality

### Feedback Delivery
- Use professional, constructive language
- Focus on content, not personal criticism
- Provide specific suggestions for improvement
- Acknowledge good content as well as issues

### Resolution Process
- Authors should respond to all feedback within 24 hours
- Disagreements should be escalated to Editor
- SMEs can request additional review if concerns remain
- Final decisions rest with Editor in case of disputes

## Review Tracking

### Documentation Requirements
- All reviews must be documented in tracking system
- Feedback must be categorized (technical, educational, structural)
- Resolution status must be tracked for each item
- Final approval must be recorded with signatures

### Version Control
- Track changes made in response to reviews
- Maintain version history of content
- Document which feedback was incorporated
- Keep record of review dates and reviewers

## SME Qualifications

### Required Qualifications
- Advanced degree in Robotics, AI, Computer Science, or related field
- Minimum 3 years of experience in Physical AI or Humanoid Robotics
- Demonstrated expertise in specific chapter topic areas
- Experience in educational content development preferred

### Ongoing Requirements
- Complete annual training on review process
- Participate in calibration sessions with other SMEs
- Maintain current knowledge in subject areas
- Adhere to quality standards and timelines

## Quality Assurance

### Random Audits
- 10% of reviewed content will be audited by senior SME
- Audit includes technical accuracy and review process compliance
- Results used to improve review process

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular feedback from reviewers on process effectiveness
- Updates to guidelines based on experience
- Training improvements based on audit results

## Tools and Resources
