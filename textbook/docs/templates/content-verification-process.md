# Content Verification Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for verifying the technical accuracy of content in the AI/Spec-Driven Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. All content must pass verification before being marked as approved.

## Verification Checklist

Before content is approved, it must pass the following checks:

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] All technical claims are factually correct
- [ ] Mathematical equations and formulas are accurate
- [ ] Code examples are functional and follow best practices
- [ ] Scientific concepts are explained correctly
- [ ] References to research papers and studies are accurate

### Educational Quality
- [ ] Content is appropriate for the target audience (beginner to intermediate)
- [ ] Concepts build logically from basic to advanced
- [ ] Learning outcomes are clearly defined and achievable
- [ ] Exercises are appropriately challenging and well-structured
- [ ] Examples are relevant and clearly illustrate concepts

### Format and Structure
- [ ] Content follows the standardized chapter template
- [ ] All required sections are present (overview, concepts, examples, exercises)
- [ ] Content is well-organized and easy to follow
- [ ] Proper headings and subheadings are used
- [ ] Cross-references and links are accurate

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Self-Review
- Author reviews content against the checklist
- Ensures all placeholders are filled with actual content
- Verifies all examples and exercises are complete

### Step 2: Peer Review
- Another team member reviews the content
- Focuses on technical accuracy and clarity
- Provides feedback on improvements

### Step 3: Subject Matter Expert Review
- Domain expert reviews technical content
- Validates accuracy of complex concepts
- Ensures no hallucinated facts are present

### Step 4: Final Approval
- Content is marked as approved by the review team
- Ready for inclusion in the textbook

## Review Roles

- **Author**: Creates the initial content and performs self-review
- **Peer Reviewer**: Provides technical and educational feedback
- **Subject Matter Expert (SME)**: Validates technical accuracy
- **Editor**: Ensures consistency with textbook standards

## Tools for Verification

- Technical reference materials and documentation
- Simulation environments for testing code examples
- Expert consultation when needed
- Cross-referencing with authoritative sources

## Quality Gates

Content must meet these minimum standards:
- All technical claims verified against authoritative sources
- No grammatical or spelling errors
- Consistent with overall textbook style and approach
- Properly formatted and structured
