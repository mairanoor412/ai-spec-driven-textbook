# AI/Spec-Driven Textbook Creation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Excellence and Accessibility
All educational content must prioritize clarity and correctness, maintaining high-quality writing suitable for beginner-intermediate learners. Content must be technically accurate for robotics, AI agents, ROS2, Gazebo/Unity, Nvidia Isaac, and VLA, with explanations that are accessible to newcomers while still valuable for practitioners.

### Modular and Maintainable Structure
Textbook content must follow a modular structure optimized for Docusaurus, with each chapter following the standardized format: Overview → Concepts → Examples → Code → Exercises. All content must be reusable, maintainable, and spec-driven using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code workflows.

### Spec-Driven Content Generation
All textbook materials must be generated and maintained using Spec-Kit Plus workflows, ensuring consistency in terminology, definitions, and chapter formatting throughout the book. Content generation must follow precise specifications and be traceable to requirements.

### Technical Accuracy and Clarity
Every technical explanation must prioritize correctness while maintaining clarity for the target audience. All code examples, diagrams, and concepts must be verified for accuracy and presented in a way that builds understanding progressively from basic to advanced concepts.

### Docusaurus-Optimized Presentation
All content must be structured for export to Docusaurus pages, with visuals/diagrams referenced using Docusaurus MDX format. Writing tone must remain friendly, instructional, and beginner-safe while preserving technical precision.

### Human-Editable Autogenerated Content
All autogenerated material must remain human-editable and logically structured, ensuring that content creators can refine and customize materials while maintaining the benefits of automated generation and consistency.

## Additional Constraints and Standards

### Content Structure Requirements
- Each chapter must follow the mandatory structure: Overview → Concepts → Examples → Code → Exercises
- Visual elements must be integrated using Docusaurus MDX format
- Terminology and definitions must remain consistent throughout the textbook
- All code examples must be tested and validated for accuracy

### Technology Stack Compliance
- Content generation must utilize Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code workflows
- Final output must be compatible with Docusaurus documentation platform
- All materials must be exportable to standard web formats
- Version control must be maintained through Git workflows

### Quality Assurance Standards
- All technical content must undergo verification for accuracy
- Educational effectiveness must be validated through peer review
- Accessibility standards must be met for diverse learning needs
- Consistency checks must be performed across chapters and sections

## Development Workflow and Review Process

### Content Creation Process
- All content must begin with clear specifications and learning objectives
- Chapters must be developed iteratively with regular validation checkpoints
- Technical accuracy must be verified by subject matter experts
- Educational effectiveness must be assessed through sample reviews

### Review and Approval Gates
- Technical accuracy review by robotics/AI subject matter experts
- Educational quality assessment by pedagogy specialists
- Accessibility and clarity validation for target audience
- Cross-referencing and consistency verification across chapters

### Quality Metrics and Standards
- Chapter completion must meet defined acceptance criteria
- Code examples must be functional and properly tested
- Learning progression must be logical and well-paced
- Content must align with stated educational objectives

## Governance

All textbook development activities must comply with this constitution. Amendments to these principles require documentation of the change rationale, approval from the core team, and a migration plan for existing content. All pull requests and reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified by clear educational benefit, and teams should reference this constitution for guidance during development decisions.
