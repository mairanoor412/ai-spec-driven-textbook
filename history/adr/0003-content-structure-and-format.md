## Context
We need to define a consistent structure for textbook chapters that supports the educational objectives while maintaining technical accuracy and accessibility for our target audience. The structure should facilitate learning progression and include all required elements (learning outcomes, examples, exercises, diagrams).

## Decision
We will structure each chapter using the following standardized format:
- Overview: Learning outcomes and chapter summary
- Concepts: Theoretical foundations and principles
- Examples: Real-world applications and scenarios
- Code: Practical implementations (where applicable)
- Exercises: Practice problems and activities

Additionally, we will organize content hierarchically as Modules → Chapters → Sections with each chapter containing 3,000-5,000 words to ensure comprehensive coverage while maintaining readability.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional textbook structure (Introduction → Body → Conclusion)
   - Pros: Familiar to readers, simple organization
   - Cons: Doesn't emphasize learning outcomes, lacks practical application focus
2. Problem-based learning structure
   - Pros: Engages students with real problems, practical focus
   - Cons: May not cover theoretical foundations adequately, harder to structure systematically
3. Standardized structure with Overview → Concepts → Examples → Code → Exercises (selected)
   - Pros: Comprehensive learning approach, systematic coverage, includes practical elements, matches educational best practices

## Consequences
- Positive: Consistent learning experience across all chapters
- Positive: Clear progression from theory to practice
- Positive: Meets educational standards with learning outcomes and exercises
- Negative: May feel formulaic to some readers
- Negative: Requires discipline to maintain structure across all chapters
