  Project: AI/Spec-Driven Textbook Creation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

  Core principles:
  - High-quality educational writing suitable for beginner–intermediate learners
  - Technical accuracy for robotics, AI agents, ROS2, Gazebo/Unity, Nvidia Isaac, and VLA
  - Modular textbook structure optimized for Docusaurus
  - Reusable, maintainable, and spec-driven content generation using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
  - Consistency in terminology, definitions, and chapter formatting throughout the book

  Key standards:
  - All technical explanations must prioritize clarity and correctness
  - Each chapter must follow: Overview → Concepts → Examples → Code → Exercises
  - Visuals/diagrams should be referenced using Docusaurus MDX format
  - Writing tone: friendly, instructional, and beginner-safe
  - All autogenerated material must remain human-editable and logically structured

  Constraints:
  - Book must be fully generated and maintained using Spec-Kit Plus workflows
  - All content must be exportable to Docusaurus pages
response_text: |
  Created a comprehensive constitution for the AI/Spec-Driven Textbook Creation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. The constitution includes six core principles:
  1. Educational Excellence and Accessibility
  2. Modular and Maintainable Structure
  3. Spec-Driven Content Generation
  4. Technical Accuracy and Clarity
  5. Docusaurus-Optimized Presentation
  6. Human-Editable Autogenerated Content

  The constitution also defines additional constraints, development workflow, and governance procedures. It has been saved to .specify/memory/constitution.md with version 1.1.0.
outcome: "Constitution successfully created and saved to .specify/memory/constitution.md"
evaluation: "The constitution aligns with all specified requirements and follows the template structure while incorporating the specific needs of the robotics textbook project."

# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Created a comprehensive constitution for the AI/Spec-Driven Textbook Creation for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project based on the specified requirements.

## Details
- **Date**: 2025-12-08
- **Stage**: constitution
- **Surface**: agent
- **Model**: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

## Process
The constitution was created by filling in the template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with specific details for the robotics textbook project. Six core principles were defined that align with the project requirements for educational excellence, technical accuracy, and spec-driven content generation.

## Results
- Created detailed core principles covering educational excellence, modularity, spec-driven generation, technical accuracy, Docusaurus optimization, and human-editable content
- Defined additional constraints and standards for content structure, technology stack, and quality assurance
- Established development workflow and review processes
- Included governance procedures for constitution compliance

## Files Created/Modified
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Updated with the complete constitution

## Follow-up Actions
- Review the constitution with stakeholders for approval
- Ensure all team members are familiar with the constitutional principles
- Use the constitution as a reference for future development decisions
